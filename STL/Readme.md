All of these were printed with a Bambu A1 in PLA.

*Button caps etc:*

- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/16mm-button-cap.stl Fits [this type](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001709481942.html) of generic pushbutton. Useful to get the colors to match your gun. Pull up the original plastic cap straight from the button and replace with this.
  
- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/d-pad%20round.stl and https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/d-pad-%2B.stl fit the [generic nav module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006370944874.html). If you enable the "make overhangs printable" option in your slicer, the round module will print without supports. May need a drop of glue to stay on the nav stick.
  
- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/tactile_switch_cap.stl fits the [front button](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003727192340.html)

*Back options:*
- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/tree/main/STL/WS2812B-Back-with-Button for use with a [neopixel module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32560280169.html) and a [6mm tact switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32873398324.html). If the button doesn't click, try varying the z-scaling of the button in your slicer a bit.
  
- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/light-ws2812.stl fits the same neopixel module as above, but without button. Use some glue to keep it in place.

*Others:*

- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/Wiimote%20Inline%20case.zip For use with [eatnooM's fantastic wiimote cam PCB](https://github.com/eatnooM/pixart-sensor-adapter) (inline). The front cover has space to glue a 10x10 mm chunk of the original wiimote IR filter into place. The small notch at the front indicates the position of the notch on the camera (points down when using [OpenFIRE](https://github.com/TeamOpenFIRE/OpenFIRE-Firmware)), the slot at the top is to better grip a zip tie.

- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/front-threads.stl allows directly screwing in the fisheye lens without needing to glue in the plastic mount that comes with the lenses. Just be aware that the threads are more sensitive than the ones in the mount. Print at 0.2mm layer height.
  
- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/slide-delete.stl allows you to mount the slide if you don't want to use the recoil setup. Eliminates the need for the linear rail, solenoid and solenoid driver, but all of them can be added at a later time. Needs 4 heat set inserts.
  
- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/Nav-Module-Right-Side.zip allows you to print a nav module cover for the right side directly on the print bed instead of upright, greatly decreasing print time and wobbliness. Glue the mounts in afterwards.

- https://github.com/Arakon/PiCON-OG-Mods/blob/main/STL/buttplug-usb.stl is for use with direct USB connection to the PC, rather than using a GX16 connector. Uses [this USB-C board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005187678366.html), pull a ziptie through after mounting it to avoid pushing the board in by accident. Works great for setups without recoil, or a 6V solenoid setup (requires a powered hub, don't try to power the solenoid from USB directly!) May need some slight filing to get the board in.
